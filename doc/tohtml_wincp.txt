*tohtml_wincp.txt* Autodetect installed Windows encodings for |:TOhtml|

This plugin will automatically add any encodings which you have installed on
your Microsoft Windows system to the g:html_encoding_override and
g:html_charset_override options of the |:TOhtml| plugin which is distributed
as part of the official Vim runtime.

This plugin has no mappings or user-defined commands. It sets up an |:autocmd|
that will be invoked the first time that you call the |:TOhtml| command or
directly |:source| the |2html.vim| script.

Because the plugin does not trigger until just before the first |:TOhtml|
conversion, you will not see any changes to the encoding detection options
right away. This is normal, do not be alarmed!

						     *tohtml_wincp-requirements*
This plugin requires:
	* Vim 7.0 or higher
	* TOhtml version vim7.3_v7 or higher
	* Windows NT/2000 or later (i.e. something that uses a System32
	  directory)

							  *tohtml_wincp-install*
To install, there are only three files you need. This |:help| file, a
tohtml_wincp.vim file to place in your |after-directory|, and another
tohtml_wincp.vim file to place in your |autoload| directory.

The easiest way to install is to use Pathogen
(http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332) and place the whole
contents of the zip file into $HOME/vimfiles/bundle. Then run the :Helptags
command provided with Pathogen.

For manual installation, simply place the files where they need to go within
your runtime, as follows:
	* $HOME/vimfiles/doc/tohtml_wincp.txt
	* $HOME/vimfiles/plugin/tohtml_wincp.vim
	* $HOME/vimfiles/autoload/tohtml_wincp.vim

Then, run "|:helptags| $HOME/vimfiles/doc" and installation is complete.

							  *tohtml_wincp-actions*
When invoked, this |:autocmd| will add to g:html_encoding_override so that
using any of the IANA-registered names for any of the installed encodings on
your system in g:html_use_encoding will automatically set the correct
'fileencoding' for the converted (x)html file.

Additionally, the plugin will add to g:html_charset_override so that |:TOhtml|
will recognize any installed encodings on your system, and add the appropriate
encoding specification to the (x)html file, if the encoding has support in all
of Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Chrome.

							 *tohtml_wincp-override*
This plugin does not override any previously existing user settings for
encoding detection in |:TOhtml|. This means that you can safely set up your
own overrides in g:html_charset_override or g:html_encoding_override without
worrying that they will be changed by the plugin.

This also means, if you don't want specific web encodings auto-detected by
|:TOhtml|, you can set up an entry in the g:html_charset_override option,
mapping the specific encodings to an empty string or the desired web encoding
to use instead. For example, if for some reason you want to convert to UTF-8
for the (x)html encoding whenever the windows-1252 encoding is used in Vim,
use the following: >
	:let g:html_charset_override = {'cp1252': 'UTF-8'}

Or, to skip using the 'fileencoding' value and fall back to the 'encoding'
value, associate the Vim encoding to an empty string. For example, to fall
back to 'encoding' for ISO-2022-KR encoded files (cp50225), use: >
	:let g:html_charset_override = {'cp50225': ''}

You can also override settings using g:html_encoding_override, but there is not
really much reason to do so, because this option will only be used when you
have explicitly specified to use the encoding in question.
