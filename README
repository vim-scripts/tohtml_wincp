This plugin will automatically add any encodings which you have installed on
your Microsoft Windows system to the g:html_encoding_override and
g:html_charset_override options of the :TOhtml plugin which is distributed
as part of the official Vim runtime.

This plugin has no mappings or user-defined commands. It sets up an :autocmd
that will be invoked the first time that you call the :TOhtml command or
directly :source the 2html.vim script.

Because the plugin does not trigger until just before the first :TOhtml
conversion, you will not see any changes to the encoding detection options
right away. This is normal, do not be alarmed!
